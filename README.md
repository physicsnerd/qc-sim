## Eval() is used in this program!

This code currently uses eval() in the custom_gate() function to allow users to input complex numbers, square roots, &c as entries for their gates. This will probably eventually be changed to a safer custom parser, but for now it will be eval(). Please do not download this to something that has public access.
