important notes for qc sim:
1) error with 4x4 not gate not working...leaves unchanged...matrix is
1000
0100
0001
0010
look into, and put in thorough testing to make sure no other weird errors in output.

2) run through probability/measurement stuff carefully! start sketching out final code.

3) put in custom parser so eval() not needed.

4) start sketching out ideas for nonideal half of simulation.
